### Example 5

Fetch data for products from https://dummyjson.com/products
(GET request) and perform useful data transformations: extract all
existing categories and print them alphabetically. Print out the three
products with the highest average review rating and the three with
the lowest. If a product has no reviews, treat its average as 0. Build
a summary per category containing the number of products, the
total inventory value (price * stock summed). Print all products that
are low stock (stock < 10) sorted by stock ascending. Print the top 5
discounted products by discount percentage (descending) showing
Title - Price - Discount%. Finally, produce a quick availability report
counting products by availability status, print everything in a
readable format and handle missing/empty arrays appropriately.
